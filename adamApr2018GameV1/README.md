To install the extension, open the game, select the "Settings" button in the toolbar, then "Extensions" in the bottom left, 
then "Install Extensions" in the top right of the window. From here, select the ZIP file (it will be named "externData.zip"), 
click ok, then ensure "External Data" is enabled in the Engine Extensions list. From here, open the game folder 
(this can be done by going above the toolbar in Stencyl and selecting Debug > View > View Folder For This Game. 
Double click the folder that corresponds to the name of your game (it should already be highlighted). 
From this directory, create a new folder named "extras" (case sensative), then place a .txt file within this new folder 
named "ext.txt", diving each quote with a new line.
